OOPS - Object Oriented Programming Systems

Object - Real world Identity - they have properties(data) and task (methods)

Class - Blue Print that object follows 

In order to communite between two class we create objects 

Polymorphism - Many Forms 
1 - Method Overloading - Compile time 
2 - Method Overriding - Run Time 

Inheritance - Method or Data from one Class can be inherited from other Class , helps in re-usability

Encapsulation/Data Hiding - Binding variables and methods under single entity 

Abstraction - Showing only essential part and hiding the implementation 
Example - when we download apk file we don't see package or code.

Real time OOPs example - -
 Mobile phone is real time entity so it is an object and it has own state , behaviour and identity
 In Mobile Phone it's specifications are classes which are logic entites example - sensors , batterries , processors
 Dialing number calls some methods internally some method is invoked but we only see functionality this is abstraction
 Bluetooth in mobile to transfer data - we can trasnfer data and access data from other mobile which we have permission this is encapsulation
 Click photos and record video - basic feature is same but different brands of mobile have different features like slow motion , split camera this is polymorphism
 Basic purpose of mobile is communcation - but by extending and adding more feature this is inheritance
