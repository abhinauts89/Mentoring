Java 8 features -

1 - Lambda Expression

It is type of function with anonymous(Nameless) function , no return type and no modifier

Why lambda - enables functional programming, readable and concise code , easier to use APi and Libraries
and enables support for parallel processing.

public int square(int num){
 return num*num;
}

(num)-> return num*num;

2 - Functional Interface

It is special type of interface containing exactly one abstract method, can have multiple static and default methods
also called Single Abstract Method interface , help us to achieve functional programming approach
if parent is functional then child is also by default functional if we are not defining any extra abstract method in child

3 - Stream API

We can perform intermediate and terminal operation ,  we can get result from streams based on operation and manipulate data easily

4 - Optional Class

To avoid null pointer exception we keep adding null check everywhere , optional class provides better way to handle this

5 - Method and Constructor Reference

Method reference are special type of lambda expression used to create simple lambda expression by referring existing methods
each time when you are using lambda expression to just refer method you can replace your lambda expression with method reference.
biggest advantage of method reference is code re-usability
this is alternative to lambda expression
